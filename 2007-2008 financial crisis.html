    <h1>2007-2008 Finacial crisis</h1>
    <p>The financial crisis of 2007â€“2008 caused significant stress on banks around the world. The failure of a large number of major banks resulted in government bail-outs. <br> The collapse and fire sale of Bear Stearns to JPMorgan Chase in March 2008 and the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September that same year led to a credit crunch and global banking crises. In response governments around the world bailed-out, nationalised or arranged fire sales for a large number of major banks. <br> Starting with the Irish government on 29 September 2008, governments around the world provided wholesale guarantees to underwriting banks to avoid panic of systemic failure to the whole banking system. <br> These events spawned the term 'too big to fail' and resulted in a lot of discussion about the moral hazard of these actions.</p>
