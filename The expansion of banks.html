    <h1>15th-17th Centuries</h1>
    <h2>Italy</h2>
    <p>Between 1527 and 1572 a number of important banking family groups arose from the Genoese Republic in northern Italy, such as the Grimaldi, Spinola and Pallavicino families, who were especially influential and wealthy, the Doria, although perhaps less influential, and the Pinelli and the Lomellini.[140][141]</p>
    <h2>Spain</h2>
    <p>In 1401 the magistrates of Barcelona, then the capital of the Principality of Catalonia, established in the city the first replication of the Venetian model of exchange and deposit, the Taula de canvi de Barcelona or Table of Exchange, considered to be the first public bank of Europe.</p>
    <h2>Germany</h2>
    <p>In the southern German realm, two great banking families emerged in the 15th century, the Fuggers and the Welsers. <br> They came to control much of the European economy and to dominate international high finance in the 16th century.[154][155][156] The Fuggers built the first German social housing area for the poor in Augsburg, the Fuggerei. It still exists, but not the original Fugger Bank which lasted from 1487 to 1657.
Dutch bankers played a central role in establishing banking in the northern German city states. Berenberg Bank is the oldest bank in Germany and the world's second oldest, established in 1590 by Dutch brothers Hans and Paul Berenberg in Hamburg. <br> The bank is still owned by the Berenberg dynasty</p>
    <h2>Netherlands</h2>
    <p>n the 16th and 17th century, precious metals from the New World, Gold Coast, Japan and other locales were being imported into Europe, with corresponding price increases. Thanks to the free coinage,[clarification needed] the Bank of Amsterdam, and the heightened trade and commerce, the Netherlands attracted even more coin and bullion to be deposited in their banks. The concepts of fractional-reserve banking and payment systems were further developed and spread to England and elsewhere</p>
    <h2>England</h2>
    <p>In the City of London there were no banking houses operating in a manner recognized as so today until the 17th century,[159][160] although the London Royal Exchange was established in 1565.</p>
